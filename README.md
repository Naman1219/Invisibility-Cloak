# Invisibility-Cloak-using-OpenCV


<--------------------------------------------------------------    DESCRIPTION    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
The Invisibility Cloak is a Fictional Theme based cloak, which is inspired from the movie Harry Potter. Using opencv, a library in python, the code specifically filters out at red color places, and shows up the pre occupied background in place of it.
